Miscellaneous resource files are kept here. Sub-programs MUST use relative
paths when referencing these files. If your build tool cannot create relative paths,
`btool` assigns the environment variable `LOCI_REPO_DIR` to the root of the repository
so you can create an absolute path that does not depend on your specific environment.
